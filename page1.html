        <p>Recent protests by LIT student union has failed to stop vodka meters being installed in Thomond village.</p>
        
        <p>Irish water has claimed that by 2020 vodka meters will be installed in all in all student villages around Ireland.This has caused uproar around the country as students struggle to pay for rent etc.</p>
        <p>Thomond village located in Limerick was the first to get these vodka meters installed.Students tried to block workers from entering the student accomadation by joining hands at the gate blocking anyone entering.This resulted in the guards being called.A stand off between the gaurds and students took place whick reportedly lasted 4 hours.Eventually workers were let in to begin installing the vodka meters. </p>
       <p>These meters are expected to track the amount of vodka consumed by each resident living in the student village and then charge them based on their intake.One student who did not want to be mentioned said "Im going to have to drink whiskey now and i dont even like the stuff but cant afford to pay the charges".Anti vodka meter campaigners have told students not to pay for the charges and have already organised a meeting with the taoiseach in the hope of coming to some sort of agreement. </p>
        <p>Many people still cant believe that there is a charge for vodka consumption and hope that this project will fail just like Irish waters attempt last year to install water meters to charge people for using water.</p>

        <p>Gardai have recieved dozens of complaints in the past few weeks of possible UFO sightings around Limerick.</p>
       <p>Locals reported hearing loud noises outside particulary at crossroads but by the time they got to the area there was no sign of anything except unusual circle markings on the road and the smell of burning rubber. </p>
        <p>Many believe these markings are a warning to the human race of an incomming attack.This has caused massive panic in the Limerick area as many believe the end of the world is near. Riots have already broken out with most shops being raided for vital supplies such as tinned foods etc.Petrol stations have run out of fuel and the cities power grid has failed leaving Limerick in a total blackout as people prepare for what is to come.Reports have suggested that most of the city has been abandoned and the remains of the city have been describes as looking like a war zone. </p>
       <p>Gardai have warned people not to believe these rumors and have told people that these markings were not caused by UFO's but in fact local boy racers doing doughnuts on the roads, but many are not convinced and the city remains abandoned.
